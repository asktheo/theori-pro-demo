                        This is an online CV and a show case for me (Theo Askov, b. 1969), as a web developer. In the menu you can find my <a href="/resume">Resume (Da)</a>, my <a href="/skills">Skills (Da)</a> and <a href="/projects">Project experience (Da)</a>. English versions will follow later on, when I add angular-translate... and a lot more work.

                    I built this site in AngularJS (Angular 1) with a back-end using a Spring-boot service behind an Apache Http Proxy. You can find the code for the front-end <a href="https://github.com/asktheo/theori-pro-demo">here</a>, and for the back-end <a href="https://github.com/asktheo/theori-pro-demo-backend">here</a>.

                     <p>In the demo section I will demonstrate different parts of the different techonologies of the web application stack. You will mainly see Single Page applications in Angular, Vue and Polymer. The content is less important to this website - I'll use my interest in nature and birds along with maps where it is suitable for the main purpose as a showcase.</p>

                    Please don't reload the pages of the different demo apps. The Apache server is not yet geared for request url mapping.
